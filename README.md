# IoT Core NXP BSP Repository Support Notice

This repository is no longer supported and is now read-only. The BSP and documentation for the iMX6, iMX7 and iMX8 processors for Windows 10 IoT is now published by NXP [here](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/embedded-software/windows-10-iot-core-for-i.mx-applications-processors:IMXWIN10IOT). Support for the BSP is available in NXP's [community forums](https://community.nxp.com/community/imx/content?filterID=contentstatus%5Bpublished%5D%7Ecategory%5Bwindows%5D).

The following repositories have been archived and made read-only on GitHub. If you have a fork of any of these repositories they will remain active, but no new updates will be supplied by Microsoft. Development has stopped in these repositories and all future work will be released by NXP in their BSP.

The repositories to be archived are:
https://github.com/ms-iot/imx-iotcore
https://github.com/ms-iot/u-boot
https://github.com/ms-iot/edk2
https://github.com/ms-iot/imx-edk2-platforms
https://github.com/ms-iot/mu_platform_nxp
https://github.com/ms-iot/mu_silicon_nxp

The NXP BSP only has board support for NXP EVK and Sabre devices. For other previously supported devices, contact the manufacturer for further support.

All compiled firmware binaries in this repository have been removed. The sources in this repository can still be built, but to generate a bootable image, the boot loaders and firmware must be manually built first according to the instructions in the Building Firmware from Source section later in this document.

## Building the BSP

### Cloning the Repository
This repository uses submodules and should be cloned with `git clone --recurse-submodules`

### Required Tools
The following tools are required to build the driver packages and IoT Core FFU: Visual Studio 2017, Windows Kits (ADK/SDK/WDK), and the IoT Core OS Packages.

#### Visual Studio 2017
* Make sure that you **install Visual Studio 2017 before the WDK** so that the WDK can install a required plugin.
* Download from https://www.visualstudio.com.
* During install select **Desktop development with C++**.
* During install select the following in the Individual components tab. If these options are not available try updating VS2017 to the latest release:
  * **VC++ 2017 version 15.9 v14.16 Libs for Spectre (ARM)**
  * **VC++ 2017 version 15.9 v14.16 Libs for Spectre (ARM64)**
  * **VC++ 2017 version 15.9 v14.16 Libs for Spectre (X86 and x64)**
  * **Visual C++ compilers and libraries for ARM**
  * **Visual C++ compilers and libraries for ARM64**

#### Windows Kits from Windows 10, version 1809
* **IMPORTANT: Make sure that any previous versions of the ADK and WDK have been uninstalled!**
* Install [ADK 1809](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-assessment-deployment-kit)
* Install [WDK 1809](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-driver-kit)
  * Make sure that you allow the Visual Studio Extension to install after the WDK install completes.
* If the WDK installer says it could not find the correct SDK version, install [SDK 1809](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk)

#### IoT Core OS Packages
* Visit the [Windows IoT Core Downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10IoTCore#!) page and download "Windows 10 IoT Core Packages â€“ Windows 10 IoT Core, version 1809 (LTSC)".
* Open the iso and install ```Windows_10_IoT_Core_ARM_Packages.msi```
* Install ```Windows_10_IoT_Core_ARM64_Packages.msi``` for ARM64 builds.

### One-Time Environment Setup
Test certificates must be installed to generate driver packages on a development machine.
1. Open an Administrator Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to your newly cloned repo and into the folder `imx-iotcore\build\tools`.
3. Launch `StartBuildEnv.bat`.
4. Run `SetupCertificate.bat` to install the test certificates.
5. Make sure that submodules have been cloned. If you cloned with `--recurse-submodules` then this step won't output anything.
    ```
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```

### FFU Generation

1. Launch Visual Studio 2017 as Administrator.
2. Open the solution iMXPlatform.sln (imx-iotcore\build\solution\iMXPlatform).
3. Change the build type from Debug to Release. Change the build flavor from ARM to ARM64 if building for iMX8.
4. To build press Ctrl-Shift-B or choose Build -> Build Solution from menu. This will compile all driver packages then generate the FFU.
5. Depending on the speed of the build machine FFU generation may take around 10-20 minutes.
6. After a successful build the new FFU will be located in `imx-iotcore\build\solution\iMXPlatform\Build\FFU\HummingBoardEdge_iMX6Q_2GB\` for ARM builds and `imx-iotcore\build\solution\iMXPlatform\Build\FFU\NXPEVK_iMX8M_4GB` for ARM64 builds.
7. The FFU contains firmware components for the HummingBoard Edge with the Quad Core SOM or NXP IMX8M EVK with i.MX8M Quad Core SOM depending on build flavor. This firmware is automatically applied to the SD Card during the FFU imaging process.

#### Building the FFU for other boards
In order to build an FFU for another board you'll need to modify GenerateFFU.bat in the Build Scripts folder of the Solution Explorer. Comment out the default HummingBoardEdge_iMX6Q_2GB or NXPEVK_iMX8M_4GB builds with REM and uncomment any other boards you want to build.
```bat
REM cd /d %BATCH_HOME%
REM echo "Building HummingBoardEdge_iMX6Q_2GB FFU"
REM call BuildImage HummingBoardEdge_iMX6Q_2GB HummingBoardEdge_iMX6Q_2GB_TestOEMInput.xml

cd /d %BATCH_HOME%
echo "Building Sabre_iMX6Q_1GB FFU"
call BuildImage Sabre_iMX6Q_1GB Sabre_iMX6Q_1GB_TestOEMInput.xml
```

### Deploy the FFU
 - Follow the instructions in the [IoT Core Manufacturing Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/iot/create-a-basic-image#span-idflashanimagespanflash-the-image-to-a-memory-card) to flash the FFU to an SD Card using the Windows IoT Core Dashboard.

### Installing to an eMMC
 - Follow the instructions in the [Booting WinPE and Flashing eMMC](Documentation/winpe-mmc.md) document.

### Adding a New Board
 - Follow the instructions in the [Adding a New Board](Documentation/newboard.md) document.

### Adding a New Driver
 - Follow the instructions in the [Adding a New Driver](Documentation/adding-drivers.md) document.

### Building the FFU with the IoT ADK AddonKit
1. Build the GenerateBSP project to create a BSP folder in the root of the repository.
2. Clone the [IoT ADK AddonKit](https://github.com/ms-iot/iot-adk-addonkit).
3. Follow the [Create a basic image instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/iot/create-a-basic-image) from the IoT Core Manufacturing guide with the following changes.
* When importing a BSP use one of the board names from the newly generated BSP folder in the imx-iotcore repo.
    ```
    Import-IoTBSP HummingBoardEdge_iMX6Q_2GB <Path to imx-iotcore\BSP>
    ```
* When creating a product use the same board name from the BSP import.
    ```
    Add-IoTProduct ProductA HummingBoardEdge_iMX6Q_2GB
    ```
